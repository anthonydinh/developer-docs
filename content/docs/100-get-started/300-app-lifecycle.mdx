title: App Lifecycle
excerpt: Learn how Raydiant apps work when running in a playlist.
---

When users configure your app via it’s inputs, we call that a _presentation._ Presentations are assigned durations, added to playlists and then published to devices.

To avoid showing loading state and [FOUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content), a Raydiant app will only become visible on screen after its [window’s `onload`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onload) handler is called.

Depending on if there is one or many presentations in the playlist, your app’s lifecycle will look a bit different.

## Single Presentation

When there is only a single presentation in a playlist, your app will be loaded in the background when the device starts.

When the device detects that the app has finished loading it will become visible on the screen.

## Multiple Presentations

When there are multiple presentations in a playlist, your app will be immediately loaded in the background when it’s the _next_ presentation in the playlist.

When the _current_ presentation is complete and your app has finished loading it will become visible on the screen.

<aside>
  It is not currently possible to hook into the playlist lifecycle to know when
  your app is in the background or when it becomes visible. However this feature
  is on the roadmap.
