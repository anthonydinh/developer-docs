excerpt: What you need to know about the on-device cache.
---

While many buildings you walk into today have an internet connection, the reality is that many [brick and mortar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_and_mortar) businesses do not have a reliable one.

Raydiant devices come with a built-in cache to make your apps resilient to network disruptions and reduce bandwidth consumption.

If the device is unable to connect to the internet, it will automatically serve cached content while the device is offline.

## On-Device Cache

All requests made by your app will automatically be cached on the device, with the exception of requests with a `Cache-Control` header value of `max-age=0`.

To enable the on-device cache, make sure to return a `Cache-Control` header value of at least `max-age=1` on all your responses.

## Reducing Bandwidth

Some customers run their devices on cellular networks with bandwidth constraints.

To minimize the amount of bandwidth used, the on-device cache will automatically cache content depending on the `Content-Type` of the request.

## Content Type TTLs

Below is a table of the TTL values of the on-device cache by content type.

Content types that never expire such as images and videos will need to be cache busted manually if they are dynamic.
